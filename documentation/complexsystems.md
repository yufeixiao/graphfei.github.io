# Complex System HCs 
In my first year at Minerva, I was most attracted to the course on complex systems. My impression was that a complex system is anything in the world that has a irreducible component, which is basically everything (except perfect heat engines and subatomic interactions with precise well-known reductions). The facade of a theory of everything attracted me. Then the realization that the generality implied many challenges in applying these beautiful ideas to specific cases (socailly, naturally) made me still more interested. 
Here I first introduce the mental models we learned (primarily from Melanie Mitchell's "Complexity: A Primer"). Then I would like to dive into the quantitative nuances and challenges of applying the concepts in differential equations and statistical mechanics. Finally I would like to extend these textbook knowledge into the review and extension of research projects related to flocking and materiality of life within the animal to cell scale. 
## Emergent Properties
In my own words, emergent property is a descriptive statistic of a set of things with relationships. For example, the fluffiness of a cotton candy does not come from the fluffiness of each molecule in it, but rather the structure of the molecules binding. 
- [ ]  Effectively identifies and explains the classification of a property as emergent or explains why specific causes give rise to the relevant property.
- [ ]  Explains the significance of a particular emergent property given the relevant problems or goals.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Makes plausible predictions about conditions under which emergent properties may manifest.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Explains the significance of emergent properties in systems.
## Systems Mapping
In my own words, a system map is a way of cutting a set of things into several subsets, where the subsets tell you something about each subset as an individual in a relation. 
- [ ]  Deconstructs a system into plausible component parts and explains how the deconstruction best serves to address a clearly articulated explanatory challenge;
- [ ]  (when applicable) effectively compares multiple deconstructions of a system.
## Complex Causality
In my own words, something in the real world usually have many events and entities that "cause" them, and those things are often affecting each other not just the target subject (those are the interesting idea of feedback loops). 
- [ ]  Accurately identifies and effectively explains causes and interactions among them that lead to a particular effect;
- [ ]  Effectively explains the significance of causal interactions to the functioning of systems;
- [ ]  (when applicable) effectively contrasts competing causal explanations, multiple effects resulting from interactions, or counterfactual causal interactions and effects.
## Networks
In my own words, a network is a description of entities and their relationships. You can make a system map into a network. Feedback can come from actions of the agents in a network. 
- [ ]  Analyzes network structure and effects by explaining why the structure described would give rise to particular effects.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Uses network analysis to propose effective interventions within a system.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Effectively justifies the definitions of nodes and edges used to construct a network.
## Systems Dynamics
In my own words, a phase diagram shows the parameter range of each probable outcome of an emergent property. 
- [ ]  Recognizes and explains the role of system dynamics in the behavior of a complex system by explaining the causes of attractors, sensitivity to varying conditions, or critical points in phase space.
- [ ]  Justifies the relevance of particular aspects of system dynamics to an explanatory problem.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Explains the significance of attractors or sensitivity to varying conditions to the functioning of systems.
## Levels of Analysis
In my own words, the emergent property can affect the individual properties and vice versa. For example, embryonic lethality of one fly species affects its relative fitness in the wild, which in turn selects for the flies that have better embyronic building plans,
- [ ]  Analyzes and explains one or more appropriate levels of analysis that are relevant to the explanatory context.
- [ ]  Justifies focus on one or more particular levels.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Explains specific interactions between levels and justifies their relevance to the explanatory challenge or context.
- [ ]  (when applicable) Explains the significance of multi-level of analysis.
