Abe, M. S. (2020). Functional advantages of LÃ©vy walks emerging near a critical point. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 117(39), 24336-24344.

A levy walk is a subset of random walk where the stepsize is sampled from an exponential distribution instead of a gaussian distribution. 
A random walk, AKA brownian motion, is a probabilistic process composed of determining the next relative location of a particle which samples its stepsize and direction from on a distribution.
$$x_i = x_{i-1} + \epsilon_i$$
$$\epsilon \tilde iid(0,\sigma^2)$$
The random walk is a minimal model that surprisingly describes many behavior in the real world through its patterns such as self-similar fractals and a relationship between sample size and variance without considering the underlying process that decided the position update. 

Previous studies show that levy walk is a common mode of biological movement. Why is it more common than other random walks, where does this movement originate mechanistically and evolutionarily?
Further, near the critical point between *order and disorder*. In the model, disorder vs order parameter looks like the strength of a chaotic dynamic (tent map) on the transition between two states. The states make a coupled oscillator, like the predator-prey dynamics. 
For more about criticality hypothesis applied to living beings, I will read [(Munoz, 2018)](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.90.031001). This seems like a seminal paper.
Levy walks are more common and more advantageous than *brownian random walk*.

This study proposes the hypothesis that critical point enhances the relative advantage of Levy walks, making them more common than at other points.
They derive this hypothesis in a model. In the model, the potential explanation behind the correlation is that at the critical point, the system can sense a larger range of environmental inputs, and the system can switch between the two phases (exploration, exploitation) that are on either sides of the critical point easier than if the system is at on phase or another.
The interesting thing about large dynamic range is that one can sense information across *scales*. 
Overall we come back to the biological (ecological) advantage of proposed mechanisms. Sensing a larger range of stimuli and switching between two states in response to a signal is useful if the environment and objective is unclear and the system needs to adjust fast. Biologically, this could look like a foraging scenario where the food locations are unpredictable and sparse. 

They then test the hypothesis by putting individual drosophila larvae. They got the disorder parameter by a method called "data-based simulation based on a twin surrogate algorithm" that lets them compare different environment perturbation while holding all else constant.

It's important to note they only examine the mechanism of levy walk that is based on internal state instead of interaction with the environment. this scenario is informed by a study that showed drosophila larvae can produce levy walk without any sensory inputs ([Sims, 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/50316)). 

The bigger set of questions explored is how does a biological organism or group convert environmental signal into behavior, and what is the relationship of this process to evolutionary adaptation as well as physical mechanisms of the organism. As a limitation, these criticality hypotheses are hard to quantify relative to different actual environment scenarios and don't have that much data to confirm the phase diagram (?).
